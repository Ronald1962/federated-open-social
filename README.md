# federated-open-social
Create an open and federated social network

Goals
=====

Create a network where users will be fully in control over their own content, where
there is no censorship, no central authority...

Design principals
=================

Users will remain fully in control over their own content.

Strategy
========

For the moment networks like Twitter and Facebook look all-powerfull. Users will not
move from these networks, if that means they will lose connections to their friends,
family and other contacts. So the new social network should provide options to keep
in touch with people on other networks, and to crosspost to these other networks.
